# FAQ

---> Can i use it? <---

Well yea, But DO NOT! Touch the footer or the teams tab! It contains credits to the developers. And if I find out that you removed the credits, I SWEAR I will take you to court or X_X 🔪


---> How to customize? <---

Just change the parts on the index.html or history.html and the bot links on the index.html, And dont change the credits.

---> How to host? <---

Thats a **You** Problem.
